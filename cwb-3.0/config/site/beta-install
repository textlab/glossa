##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: Classic setup (compatible with CWB releases before 3.0)
##

## Inherits from standard configuration (only difference is registry directory)
include $(TOP)/config/site/standard

## Beta-testing versions install in separate directory tree (but share global registry).
## 
## If you want to always install beta versions to the usual location, define 
## CWB_LIVE_DANGEROUSLY as an environment variable; a should-be-portable command for this is
## sudo echo "export CWB_LIVE_DANGEROUSLY=1 && ./install-scripts/cwb-install-$YOUR_OS" | sudo bash
ifndef CWB_LIVE_DANGEROUSLY
PREFIX=/usr/local/cwb-$(VERSION)
endif
