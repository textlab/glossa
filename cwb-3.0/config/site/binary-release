##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: Binary releases (generic)
##

## Binary releases should always use standard configuration settings
include $(TOP)/config/site/standard

# - installation prefix defaults to /usr/local
# - registry directory defaults to  /usr/local/share/cwb/registry

## Access permission for installed files (octal code for regular files)
INST_PERM = 644

## Binary releases should use static linking for better portability and ease of installation.
## Many recent operating systems don't support fully static linking, though, so this is not made the default.
