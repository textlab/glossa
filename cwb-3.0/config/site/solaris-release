##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: Binary release for Solaris 8 (SunOS 2.8) on UltraSPARC
##

## Inherits from generic configuration for binary releases
include $(TOP)/config/site/binary-release

# Solaris doesn't provide a static version of the dynamic linking library libdl.a, so we need
# to provide stubs for the dlclose(), dlopen(), and dlsym() functions referenced in libc.a
# (the static build doesn't use dynamic linking, so the functions are never needed).
# These stubs are in cl/dl_stub.o, which other platforms (and the dynamically linked Solaris version) MUST NOT link.
SITE_LDFLAGS = -static ../cl/dl_stub.o

# Solaris doesn't include GNU-compatible 'tar' program, so require separately installed 'gtar'
TAR = gtar
