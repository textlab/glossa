##
##  TEMPLATE FOR SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILES
##

#
# A) Required settings
#

## Directory tree where binaries, libraries, header files and man pages will be installed
PREFIX = /usr/local

## Default registry directory (used unless -r option or CORPUS_REGISTRY variable is set)
DEFAULT_REGISTRY = $(PREFIX)/share/cwb/registry

## Access permission for installed files (octal code for regular files)
INST_PERM = 644

#
# B) Optional settings
#

## Set owner and group of installed files (default: not changed)
# INST_USER = ???
# INST_GROUP = ???

## Additional site-specific compiler and linker flags (e.g. include directories for libraries
## that are not installed in standard locations).  These settings are _added_ to the platform-wide
## CFLAGS and LDFLAGS options (if you need to override them, set CFLAGS / LDFLAGS directly).
# SITE_CFLAGS = 
# SITE_LDFLAGS = 

## Install locations for different types of files are automatically computed from PREFIX, but
## you can override any of the defaults shown below:
# BININSTDIR = $(PREFIX)/bin
# MANINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)/share/man
# LIBINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)/lib
# INCINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)/include/cwb

## Change format of compilation date ("cqp -v"), or lie about the true date (must be quoted string):
# COMPILE_DATE = "1 April 2007"
