##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE: Solaris 8 (SunOS 2.8) on UltraSPARC CPU
##

## Inherits from generic Unix configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/unix

## Standard Solaris doesn't include ncurses library, but has compatible termcap
TERMCAP_LIBS = -ltermcap

## Optimisation for UltraSPARC, but remain compatible with SuperSPARC architecture
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -mcpu=supersparc -mtune=ultrasparc 
## Solaris doesn't have setenv() for manipulating environment variables, so we need to emulate it with putenv()
CFLAGS += -DEMULATE_SETENV

## Solaris requires additional libraries for socket/network support
## (Documentation suggests -lxnet, but there is no statically linkable version of this library)
NETWORK_LIBS = -lsocket -lnsl 

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = sparc
RELEASE_OS = solaris
