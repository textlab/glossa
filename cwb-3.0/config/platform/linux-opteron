##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE: Linux 2.x on AMD Opteron CPU (x86_64 architecture)
##

## Inherits from generic Linux configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/linux

## Override standard CFLAGS for better optimisation and Opteron tuning 
CFLAGS = -O3 -march=opteron -mtune=opteron

# 64-bit CPUs seem to require position-independent code
CFLAGS += -fPIC -m64

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = x86_64
