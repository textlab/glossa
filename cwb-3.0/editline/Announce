	        Editline Command Line Editing Library
		          CSTR Distribution

		     Version 1.2-cstr, July 1999

Editline is a small library providing command line editing and comand
history for programs. Editline provides an identical calling interface
to a small subset of the Free Software Foundation 'readline'
library. It is intended to be useful in situations when readline is
too big or when the FSF licencing conditions make that library
unusable. 

Editline was posted to comp.sources.misc by Rich Salz in August
1992. This release is the result of work at CSTR to extend editline so
as to be able to use it in place of readline in the festival
speech synthesis system.

Major differnces from the comp.sources.misc version include:

	Long lines handled better.
	Incremental history search.
	Calls to read and write history file.
	Some Windows support.
	Termios, termio or sgttyb used as appropriate.
