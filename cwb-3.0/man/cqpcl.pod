=head1 NAME

cqpcl - The corpus query processor of the CWB (command-line version)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cqpcl> [-hvmscixS] [-D I<corpus>] [-r I<registry_dir>]
    [-l I<data_dir>] [-I I<init_file>] [-M I<macro_file>]
    [-W I<n>] [-L I<n>] [-R I<n>] [-b I<n>] [-d I<mode>]
    ( [-E I<variable>] | 'I<command>' ... )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<TODO>

B<Use of this command-line version of CQP is deprecated>, due to security issues and problems with shell metacharacters.
B<It may no longer be included in future releases of the CWB.>  The recommended methods for batch
processing with CQP are to run it as a slave process in the background (which is facilitated by
he C<-c> option and interface packages for various programming languages), or to read an automatically
generated CQP script file with the C<-f> option.
