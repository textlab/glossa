# RGlossa

RGlossa is a reimplementation of the [Glossa search system](https://github.com/noklesta/glossa_svn) in Ruby on Rails.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.9.2
* PostgreSQL. RGlossa is being developed with version 9.1, but other versions may work as well.
* [The IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB)](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/). Check out the latest version from SVN to get support for UTF-8-encoded corpora.
